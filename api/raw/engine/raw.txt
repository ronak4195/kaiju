func RegisterEntityData(value EntityData) error

TYPES

type Entity struct {
	Transform matrix.Transform
	Parent    *Entity
	Children  []*Entity

	OnDestroy    events.Event
	OnActivate   events.Event
	OnDeactivate events.Event

	EditorBindings entityEditorBindings

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Entity is a struct that represents an arbitrary object in the host system.
    It contains a 3D transformation and can be a parent of, or a child to,
    other entities. Entities can also contain arbitrary named data to make it
    easier to access data that is specific to the entity.

    Child entities are unordered by default, you'll need to call
    #Entity.SetChildrenOrdered to make them ordered. It is recommended to leave
    children unordered unless you have a specific reason to order them.

func NewEntity(workGroup *concurrent.WorkGroup) *Entity
    NewEntity creates a new #Entity struct and returns it

func (e *Entity) Activate()
    Activate will set an active flag on the entity that can be queried with
    #Entity.IsActive. It will also set the active flag on all children of the
    entity. If the entity is already active, this function will do nothing.

func (e *Entity) AddNamedData(key string, data interface{})
    AddNamedData allows you to add arbitrary data to the entity that can be
    accessed by a string key. This is useful for storing data that is specific
    to the entity.

    Named data is stored in a map of slices, so you can add multiple pieces of
    data to the same key. It is recommended to compile the data into a single
    structure so the slice length is 1, but sometimes that's not reasonable.

func (e *Entity) ChildAt(idx int) *Entity
    ChildAt returns the child entity at the specified index

func (e *Entity) ChildCount() int
    ChildCount returns the number of children the entity has

func (e *Entity) Copy(other *Entity)

func (e *Entity) Deactivate()
    Deactivate will set an active flag on the entity that can be queried with
    #Entity.IsActive. It will also set the active flag on all children of the
    entity. If the entity is already inactive, this function will do nothing.

func (e *Entity) Deserialize(stream io.Reader, host *Host) error
    Deserialize will read the entity from the given stream and is reversed using
    #Serialize. This will not deserialize the children of the entity, that is
    the responsibility of the caller. All errors returned will be related to
    decoding the binary stream

func (e *Entity) Destroy()
    Destroy will set the destroyed flag on the entity, this can be queried with
    #Entity.IsDestroyed. The entity is not immediately destroyed as it may be in
    use for the current frame. The #Entity.TickCleanup should be called for each
    frame to check if the entity is ready to be completely destroyed.

    Destroying a parent will also destroy all children of the entity.

func (e *Entity) Duplicate(sparse bool, onDupe func(from, to *Entity)) *Entity

func (e *Entity) FindByName(name string) *Entity
    FindByName will search the entity and the tree of children for the first
    entity with the specified name. If no entity is found, nil will be returned.

func (e *Entity) HasChildRecursive(child *Entity) bool

func (e *Entity) HasChildren() bool
    HasChildren returns true if the entity has any children

func (e *Entity) Id() EntityId
    ID returns the unique identifier of the entity. The Id is only valid for
    entities that are not generated through template instantiation. The Id may
    also be stripped during game runtime if the entity is never externally
    referenced by any other part of the system.

func (e *Entity) IndexOfChild(child *Entity) int

func (e *Entity) Init(workGroup *concurrent.WorkGroup)

func (e *Entity) IsActive() bool
    IsActive will return true if the entity is active, false otherwise

func (e *Entity) IsDestroyed() bool
    IsDestroyed will return true if the entity is destroyed, false otherwise

func (e *Entity) IsRoot() bool
    IsRoot returns true if the entity is the root entity in the hierarchy

func (e *Entity) Name() string
    Name returns the name of the entity

func (e *Entity) NamedData(key string) []interface{}
    NamedData will return the data associated with the specified key. If the key
    does not exist, nil will be returned.

func (e *Entity) RemoveNamedData(key string, data interface{})
    RemoveNamedData will remove the specified data from the entity's named data
    map. If the key does not exist, this function will do nothing.

    *This will remove the entire slice and all of it's data*

func (e *Entity) Root() *Entity
    Root will return the root entity of the entity's hierarchy

func (e *Entity) Serialize(stream io.Writer) error
    Serialize will write the entity to the given stream and is reversed using
    #Deserialize. This will not serialize the children of the entity, that is
    the responsibility of the caller. All errors returned will be related to
    decoding the binary stream

func (e *Entity) SetActive(isActive bool)
    SetActive will set the active flag on the entity that can be queried with
    #Entity.IsActive. It will also set the active flag on all children of the
    entity. If the entity is already active, this function will do nothing.

func (e *Entity) SetChildrenOrdered()
    SetChildrenOrdered sets the children of the entity to be ordered

func (e *Entity) SetChildrenUnordered()
    SetChildrenUnordered sets the children of the entity to be unordered

func (e *Entity) SetName(name string)
    SetName sets the name of the entity

func (e *Entity) SetParent(newParent *Entity)
    SetParent will set the parent of the entity. If the entity already has
    a parent, it will be removed from the parent's children list. If the new
    parent is nil, the entity will be removed from the hierarchy and will become
    the root entity. If the new parent is not nil, the entity will be added to
    the new parent's children list. If the new parent is not active, the entity
    will be deactivated as well.

    This will also handle the transformation parenting internally

func (e *Entity) TickCleanup() bool
    TickCleanup will check if the entity is ready to be completely destroyed. If
    the entity is ready to be destroyed, it will execute the #Entity.OnDestroy
    event and return true. If the entity is not ready to be destroyed, it will
    return false.

type EntityData interface {
	Init(entity *Entity, host *Host)
}

type EntityId string
    EntityId is a string that represents a unique identifier for an entity.
    The identifier is only valid for entities that are not generated through
    template instantiation. The identifier may also be stripped during game
    runtime if the entity is never externally referenced by any other part of
    the system.

type FrameId = uint64
    FrameId is a unique identifier for a frame

type Host struct {
	Window    *windowing.Window
	LogStream *logging.LogStream

	Camera   cameras.Camera
	UICamera cameras.Camera

	Drawings rendering.Drawings

	Closing       bool
	UIUpdater     Updater

	LateUpdater   Updater

	OnClose     events.Event
	CloseSignal chan struct{}

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Host is the mediator to the entire runtime for the game/editor. It is the
    main entry point for the game loop and is responsible for managing all
    entities, the window, and the rendering context. The host can be used to
    create and manage entities, call update functions on the main thread,
    and access various caches and resources.

    The host is expected to be passed around quite often throughout the program.
    It is designed to remove things like service locators, singletons, and other
    global state. You can have multiple hosts in a program to isolate things
    like windows and game state.

func NewHost(name string, logStream *logging.LogStream) *Host
    NewHost creates a new host with the given name and log stream. The log
    stream is the log handler that is used by the slog package functions. A Host
    that is created through NewHost has no function until #Host.Initialize is
    called.

    This is primarily called from #host_container/New

func (host *Host) AddEntities(entities ...*Entity)
    AddEntities adds multiple entities to the host. This will add the entities
    using the same rules as AddEntity. If the host is in the process of creating
    editor entities, then the entities will be added to the editor entity pool.

func (host *Host) AddEntity(entity *Entity)
    AddEntity adds an entity to the host. This will add the entity to the
    standard entity pool. If the host is in the process of creating editor
    entities, then the entity will be added to the editor entity pool.

func (host *Host) AssetDatabase() *assets.Database
    AssetDatabase returns the asset database for the host

func (host *Host) Audio() *audio.Audio
    Audio returns the audio system for the host

func (host *Host) ClearEntities()
    ClearEntities will remove all entities from the host. This will remove all
    entities from the standard entity pool only. The entities will be destroyed
    using the standard destroy method, so they will take not be fully removed
    during the frame that this function was called.

func (host *Host) Close()
    Close will set the closing flag to true and signal the host to clean up
    resources and close the window.

func (host *Host) CreatingEditorEntities()
    CreatingEditorEntities is used exclusively for the editor to know that
    the entities that are being created are for the editor. This is used to
    logically separate editor entities from game entities.

    This will increment so it can be called many times, however it is expected
    that #Host.DoneCreatingEditorEntities is be called the same number of times.

func (h *Host) Deadline() (time.Time, bool)
    Deadline is here to fulfil context.Context and will return zero and false

func (h *Host) Done() <-chan struct{}
    Done is here to fulfil context.Context and will cose the CloseSignal channel

func (host *Host) DoneCreatingEditorEntities()
    DoneCreatingEditorEntities is used to signal that the editor is done
    creating entities. This should be called the same number of times as
    #Host.CreatingEditorEntities. When the internal counter reaches 0, then any
    entity created on the host will go to the standard entity pool.

func (host *Host) Entities() []*Entity
    Entities returns all the entities that are currently in the host. This
    will return all entities in the standard entity pool only. In the editor,
    this will not return any entities that have been destroyed (and are pending
    cleanup due to being in the undo history)

func (host *Host) EntitiesRaw() []*Entity
    Entities returns all the entities that are currently in the host. This
    will return all entities in the standard entity pool only. In the editor,
    this will also return any entities that have been destroyed (and are pending
    cleanup due to being in the undo history)

func (h *Host) Err() error
    Err is here to fulfil context.Context and will return nil or
    context.Canceled

func (host *Host) FindEntity(id EntityId) (*Entity, bool)
    FindEntity will search for an entity contained in this host by its id.
    If the entity is found, then it will return the entity and true, otherwise
    it will return nil and false.

func (host *Host) FontCache() *rendering.FontCache
    FontCache returns the font cache for the host

func (host *Host) Frame() FrameId
    Frame will return the current frame id

func (host *Host) Initialize(width, height, x, y int) error
    Initializes the various systems and caches that are mediated through the
    host. This includes the window, the shader cache, the texture cache,
    the mesh cache, and the font cache, and the camera systems.

func (host *Host) InitializeAudio() error

func (host *Host) MeshCache() *rendering.MeshCache
    MeshCache returns the mesh cache for the host

func (host *Host) Name() string
    Name returns the name of the host

func (host *Host) NewEntity() *Entity
    NewEntity creates a new entity and adds it to the host. This will add
    the entity to the standard entity pool. If the host is in the process of
    creating editor entities, then the entity will be added to the editor entity
    pool.

func (host *Host) RemoveEntity(entity *Entity)
    RemoveEntity removes an entity from the host. This will remove the entity
    from the standard entity pool. This will determine if the entity is in the
    editor entity pool and remove it from there if so, otherwise it will be
    removed from the standard entity pool. Entities are not ordered, so they are
    removed in O(n) time. Do not assume the entities are ordered at any time.

func (host *Host) Render()
    Render will render the scene. This starts by preparing any drawings that
    are pending. It also creates any pending shaders, textures, and meshes
    before the start of the render. The frame is then readied, buffers swapped,
    and any transformations that are dirty on entities are then cleaned.

func (host *Host) ReserveEntities(additional int)

func (host *Host) RunAfterFrames(wait int, call func())
    RunAfterFrames will call the given function after the given number of frames
    have passed from the current frame

func (host *Host) Runtime() float64
    Runtime will return how long the host has been running in seconds

func (h *Host) SetFrameRateLimit(fps int64)
    SetFrameRateLimit will set the frame rate limit for the host. If the frame
    rate is set to 0, then the frame rate limit will be removed.

    If a frame rate is set, then the host will block until the desired frame
    rate is reached before continuing the update loop.

func (host *Host) ShaderCache() *rendering.ShaderCache
    ShaderCache returns the shader cache for the host

func (host *Host) Teardown()
    Teardown will destroy the host and all of its resources. This will also
    execute the OnClose event. This will also signal the CloseSignal channel.

func (host *Host) TextureCache() *rendering.TextureCache
    TextureCache returns the texture cache for the host

func (host *Host) Update(deltaTime float64)
    Update is the main update loop for the host. This will poll the window for
    events, update the entities, and render the scene. This will also check if
    the window has been closed or crashed and set the closing flag accordingly.

    The update order is FrameRunner -> Update -> LateUpdate -> EndUpdate:

    [-] FrameRunner: Functions added to RunAfterFrames [-] UIUpdate: Functions
    added to UIUpdater [-] UILateUpdate: Functions added to UILateUpdater
    [-] Update: Functions added to Updater [-] LateUpdate: Functions added to
    LateUpdater [-] EndUpdate: Internal functions for preparing for the next
    frame

    Any destroyed entities will also be ticked for their cleanup. This will also
    tick the editor entities for cleanup.

func (h *Host) Value(key any) any
    Value is here to fulfil context.Context and will always return nil

func (h *Host) WaitForFrameRate()
    WaitForFrameRate will block until the desired frame rate limit is reached

func (host *Host) WorkGroup() *concurrent.WorkGroup
    WorkGroup returns the work group for this instance of host

type Updater struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Updater is a struct that stores update functions to be called when the
    #Updater.Update function is called. This simply goes through the list from
    top to bottom and calls each function.

    *Note that update functions are unordered, so don't rely on the order*

func NewUpdater() Updater
    NewUpdater creates a new #Updater struct and returns it

func (u *Updater) AddUpdate(update func(float64)) int
    AddUpdate adds an update function to the list of updates to be called when
    the #Updater.Update function is called. It returns the id of the update
    function that was added so that it can be removed later.

    The update function is added to a back-buffer so it will not begin updating
    until the next call to #Updater.Update.

func (u *Updater) Destroy()
    Destroy cleans up the updater and should be called when the updater is no
    longer needed. It will close the pending and complete channels and clear the
    updates map.

func (u *Updater) RemoveUpdate(id int)
    RemoveUpdate removes an update function from the list of updates to be
    called when the #Updater.Update function is called. It takes the id of the
    update function that was returned when the update function was added.

    The update function is removed from a back-buffer so it will not be removed
    until the next call to #Updater.Update.

func (u *Updater) StartConcurrent(goroutines int)
    StartConcurrent starts the number of goroutines specified to handle updates
    concurrently. This will no longer use inline updates once this function is
    called and all updates will be handled through the goroutines.

func (u *Updater) Update(deltaTime float64)
    Update calls all of the update functions that have been added to the
    updater. It takes a deltaTime parameter that is the approximate amount of
    time since the last call to #Updater.Update.
